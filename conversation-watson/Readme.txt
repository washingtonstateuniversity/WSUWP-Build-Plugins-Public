This plugin allows you to easily add chatbots powered by IBM Watson Assistant to your website.

== Description ==

Add this plugin to your site and let IBM Watson help you better support your customers. In a few minutes, you can train Watson to answer frequently asked questions, provide useful information and help them navigate your website. And if they want to talk to a human, the plugin can connect them to a real operator via telephone.

This plugin uses IBM Watson Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation) on the IBM Cloud. You can use it with an IBM Cloud Lite account free of charge and without a need to provide a credit card. If you take [this free course](https://cocl.us/build-a-chatbot) you may get a special offer of US$1200 of IBM Cloud usage to deploy chatbots for much higher usage. If you build web sites and chatbots as a business you may qualify for [a special ISV program](https://cocl.us/CB0103EN_WATR_WPP).

Currently supported features:

* Take advantage of [Rich responses](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/dialog-overview.html#multimedia) to add images, pauses, and clickable responses to your chatbot
* Use user's account data such as name in chatbot dialog
* Easy VOIP calling powered by Twilio for users to contact a real person if they wish
* Simple plugin setup to get your Watson Assistant chatbot available to users as soon as possible
* Control usage of the Watson Assistant service directly from the plugin settings page
* Choose the pages and posts you want the visitors to see the chat bot on
* Customize the appearance of the chat box to your preference

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

This plugin requires the [WordPress REST API Plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) to be installed. If you have WordPress 4.7 or later, this is installed by default.

= Installing the Plugin =

1. Log in to your site’s Dashboard.
1. Click on the `Plugins` tab in the left panel, then click the `Add New` button.
1. Search for “Watson Assistant” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.
1. Install the plugin by clicking the `Install Now` link.
1. When installation finishes, click `Activate Plugin`.

This plugin can also be installed manually.

**Note:**
If your WordPress site is hosted by WordPress (with a URL like `websitename.wordpress.com`), you need a paid plan to install plugins. If your WordPress is hosted separately, you should have no issue.

= Building Your Chatbot =

1. Learn how to set up your Watson Assistant chatbot with [this quick free course](https://cocl.us/build-a-chatbot).

1. [Sign up for a free IBM Cloud Lite account.](https://cocl.us/bluemix-registration)

1. You can see [the Watson Assistant documentation](https://cocl.us/watson-conversation-help) for more information.

Once you've created your workspace using the course or the link above, you must connect it to your Wordpress site.

= Setting up the Plugin =

1.  From the Deploy tab of your workspace, you must obtain your username and password credentials in addition to the Workspace URL of your new workspace.

1. Enter these on the "Main Setup" tab of your settings page. Once you click "Save Changes", the plugin will verify if the credentials are valid and notify you of whether or not the configuration was successful. 

1. (Optional) By default, the chatbot shows up on all pages of your website. In the Behaviour tab of your settings page, you can choose which pages to show the chat bot on. You can also show the chat box inline within posts and pages using the shortcode `[watson-chat-box]`

**Note:**
If you have a server-side caching plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, you may need to clear your cache after changing settings or deactivating the plugin. Otherwise, your action may not take effect.
