==  Related Products as a Powerful Marketing Tool ==

Displaying related products has become the best strategy for selling products. This feature has a great influence on making customers purchase from your store. Showing related products at each stage of a product purchase increases the stores' profit multiple times. eCommerce giant Amazon's success is the best example of the related products technique. It acts literally like a virtual salesperson who accompanies us with better recommendations of choices throughout our purchase in the store.

It is also seen that when customers keep getting recommendations while purchasing a product it increases their confidence in the product thereby simplifying the decision making process without spending a lot of time on it. Thus online purchasing would be a great option for people who hate shopping or who do not have the time or patience for it.

==  Different ways to Show Related products on your WooCommerce store ==

WooCommerce Related Products feature is one of the important sales tools available for store owners. "Related products" can be employed on your website in different forms. When built-in features in WooCommerce enable you to manually list related products like upsells and cross-sells, with the help of third-party plugins you can equip your store to automatically list related products depending upon the activities of customers on your WooCommerce store. 

Up-sells -   These products are shown on the product page as an alternative to the product customers have chosen to purchase. There will be an upgrade of the chosen product either in quality or price thereby persuading the customer to choose the better one. It comes under the default text "you may also like".

Cross-sells - On contrary to up-sells cross-sells are displayed on the cart page under the title "you may be interested in".  These products would complement the products currently in the cart. On seeing this customers would feel an urge to buy the complementary products along with the products in their cart thereby selling more products for the store. Notifying customers about phone cases while purchasing a phone would be a perfect example of cross-selling.
