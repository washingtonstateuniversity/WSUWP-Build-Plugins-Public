Transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience without requiring you to connect to WordPress.com

== Description ==

I love this Carousel feature that is part of the JetPack plugin however I didn't like that I was being forced to connect my site with WordPress.com to use a feature that has no connection with WordPress.com. Well, I simply forked the Carousel module from JetPack. I am releasing it for all those who want to use this feature with freedom of choice.

The carousel feature transforms your standard built-in WordPRess galleries into an immersive full-screen experience with comments and EXIF metadata.

Want to make your WordPress photo gallery stand out? Then use this jQuery Gallery Carousel without Jetpack plugin.

Gallery Carousel feature was first intorduced for WordPress.com blogs, and now it is available for all WordPress sites. So YES you can <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-properly-move-your-blog-from-wordpress-com-to-wordpress-org/" title="switch from WordPress.com to WordPress.org" rel="friend">switch from WordPress.com to WordPress.org</a> and still keep the Gallery Carousel functionality by using this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How will you make sure to keep this upto date?**

Well this code is literally a copy of JetPack module. I will keep a close eye on every JetPack update. If they update this module, then I will be sure to update this plugin as well.

**How can I get rid of the Comments?**

I thought long and hard about whether to add this feature in the gallery carousel or not. Because the goal is to transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience, I think that comments are necessary. This is why I will NOT be adding an option to turn the comments off.

However, if you want to turn off comments on Media attachments, you can follow this tutorial:
